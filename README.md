## What is this?
  - ThermaDrone is an **Android** application that enables you to automate your DJI Product. You can control flight situation, setting waypoints on the map and setting configuration to let your drone fly autonomously, following pre-imposted path, speed and altitude.
  - The application is part of a project that was implemented during the "ICT Innovation" course (2016/2017) at the University of Trento. The complete project provides also the possibility to watch the live streaming of a Thermal camera (Seek camera); this camera is connected to the Drone through a Raspberry Pi that enables the streaming (Using other hardware tools like Wi-Fi dongle, external battery, microusb cable)

  - ThermaDrone was built thanks to the [DJI Mobile SDK Documentation](https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/index.html). It is possible to use this app just to fly the Drone in an autonomous way. In this case everyone have the possibility to add new technologies to the drone, experience and enjoy!

After that you download or clone this project, you'll need to open it as "Existing project" with Android Studio.
  - If there are no problems, you now need to generate a **DJI app key** and a **Google key**
